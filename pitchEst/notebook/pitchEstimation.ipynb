The sounds used from Freesound come from three different sources: the users Carlos Vaquero and Modular Samples and; the soundpacks containing the tag: 'good-sounds'. The non-Freesound sounds come from sources mentioned in the masterthesis '$TITLE$' of Carlos Vaquero [$REF$], namely sounds from the Philharmonia Orchestra [$REF$] and the piano pack from The University of Iowa Musical Instrument Samples (or as they call it MIS) [$REF$]. \n",

    "All of the sounds are single-note sounds from either instruments or synthesisers. The sounds from the user Carlos Vaquero are recordings from different western instruments containing for example: acoustic guitar, recorders, bassoon, several bowed instruments (played plucked, bowed and with different bowing techniques). The sounds with the tag good-sounds are also single-notes of several western instruments, but only played with a 'normal' playing technique. The sounds from the user Modular Samples are all single notes played on a digital synthesiser using different presets.\n",
    "The sounds from the Philharmonia Orchestra are several (vast) collections of sounds from different instruments, played in a wide range of manners, of the orchestra. The sounds chosen here are the cello, clarinet, guitar and violin. The sounds from \n",

As the results of the pitch estimation can be dependent on the characteristics of the types of sounds and the manner in which they are recorded, the results can be influenced heavily by the characteristics and recording manner of these sounds. For this reason the error values of the Modular Samples and Philharmonia sounds will be averaged over several samples taken from all their sounds."

The confidence measurements from the pitchYinFFT algorithm and the annotated pitches will be compared to the succes of the estimations and the values of some aural and musical descriptors will be correlated to the error values obtained in the assessment.\n"
