Pitch Estimation:
-   What are good predictors for pitch estimation errors:
    -   Confidence
        -   How is confidence calculated? can it be used to predict the error of the pitch estimate?
        -   confidence in freesound?
    -   Salience
        -   Can salience predict the error of the pitch estimate?
        -   salience from python essentia?
    -   Other?

-   statistical analysis of freesound pitch estimates assesment (percentage of succes/failure)
    -   where and why does it fail?? (confidence/ salience factors??)
-   assesment of essentia pitchYinFFT on downloaded sounds (freesoundand and IOWA and philharmonic)
    -   where and why does it fail??
-   improvements:   
    -   improvements of usage of pitchYinFFT?  
    -   improve pitchYinFFT?
