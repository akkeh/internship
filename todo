Update plan and schedule

Pitch Estimation:
-   statistical analysis of freesound pitch estimates assesment (percentage of succes/failure)
    -   where and why does it fail?? (confidence/ salience factors??)
        -   pTag, pEst, salience, confidence, etc. of high error sounds
-   assesment of essentia pitchYinFFT on downloaded sounds (freesoundand and IOWA and philharmonic)
    -   where and why does it fail??
        -   pTag, pEst, salience, confidence, etc. of high error sounds
-   Differences between Freesound and essentia??
-   improvements:   
    -   improvements of usage of pitchYinFFT?  
    -   improve pitchYinFFT?
    ->  delve into code of pitchYinFFT
